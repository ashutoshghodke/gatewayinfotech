All students are required to complete at least 1000 practice questions from the shared website.
This exercise is designed to strengthen your programming logic and enhance problem-solving skills.
I kindly request everyone to complete this assessment diligently to further hone your programming abilities.
Once completed, we will continue with the remaining topics in our next session on Monday.
